# Glass Bridge Monte Carlo

What are the odds of each player surviving the glass bridge challenge in Squid Game, if played fairly? By "fairly", I mean players go in the exact order as they are assigned, so no jumping ahead, refusing to go, or pushing others off. I also do not consider time limit for simplicity.

## Rules

1. 16 players are assigned from 1 to 16, and they cross the bridge in that order;
2. The bridge has 18 steps, each with 2 glass panels. One is safe, the other is not. So the probability of success is 0.5 at each step.
